Tired of constantly jumping between terminal tabs to check the status of your git repositories? Surprised to find a repo is way behind after making a few changes? Well, jump no more! Introducing the Git Status Monitor ‚Äì your one-stop shop for keeping tabs on all your git repos in real-time.

## Getting Started üèÅ

To get this party started, `npx git-status-dash` watches whatever directory it is run in.

You can also install it globally with `npm install -g git-status-dash` and run it from anywhere with `git-status-dash`.

```bash
# Opens in tui mode (thanks @zkbkb)
npx git-status-dash -t

# Open another directory
npx git-status-dash -d ~/code/

# Get help
npx git-status-dash --help
```

### Running by hand

Or, if you'd like to clone the repo, first make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the `git-status-monitor.js` file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Make the script executable with `chmod +x git-status-monitor.js`.
5. Run the script with `./git-status-monitor.js`.

## What's it telling me? ü§î

The table displays the following information for each repository:

- Repository name (relative to the scanned directory)
- Status icon and details:
  - ‚úì (green): The repository is in sync with the remote.
  - ‚Üë (yellow): The local branch is ahead of the remote by the specified number of commits.
  - ‚Üì (yellow): The local branch is behind the remote by the specified number of commits.
  - ‚úï (red): There are uncommitted changes or the repository is not a valid git repo.

The repositories are sorted by the most recently modified ones at the top, so you can quickly see which repos need your attention.

## Happy Monitoring! üòÑ

Now go forth and conquer your git workflow with the power of the Git Status Monitor. May your commits be clean and your branches always in sync!
